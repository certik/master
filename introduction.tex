Our ultimate goal is to be able to calculate large electron structure problems
using density functional theory, pseudopotentials and finite element method.
That's a very difficult problem, that people only very recently started to
tackle \cite{pask1, pask2, ortiz1, ortiz2}.

Chapter 2 contains detailed motivation.

In the chapter 3 we summarize the theory and full ab-initio
derivation of all equations in finite elements, density functional theory and
pseudopotentials.

Chapter 4 then explains how our program works and we show results for
spherically symmetric potentials in relativistic and nonrelativistic DFT and
for 2D and 3D Schr\"odinger equation for symmetric and non-symmetric
potentials.

Finally the appendix contains a thorough derivation of relativistic equations
form the quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the derivation of QED from the
standard model. It also contains many other useful explanations, like delta
functions, variations, functional derivatives, dirac notation and other things.
