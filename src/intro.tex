\chapter{Introduction}

These are our notes on DFT and pseudopotentials calculations using
a finite element method. We tried to include all the necessary theory starting
from the many body Schr\"odinger equation. There are numerous books and
articles on this topic, but the problem is first that the information is
scattered among many publications and second that the theory in other sources
is many times very lenghty and sometimes not very clear, sometimes it
suppresses several important details, which are needed in order to write a
computer program. So the reader should be able to understand every single
detail just from this text. 

We have added the appendix with all the necessary information one has to know
about a delta function, variations and functional derivatives, spherical
harmonics and the dirac notation in order to be able to use it in calculations
and understand formulas.
