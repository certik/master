In this thesis, we introduce the ingredients that are necessary for the new
method for electronic structure calculations of non-periodic systems that
should be based on density functional theory, ab-initio pseudopotentials and
finite element method. We reviewed all the theory that we need, in particular
density functional theory, radial Dirac and Schr\"odinger equations, Kohn-Sham
equations, pseudopotentials and their separable form, and finite elements.

We then show thorough examples of results of testing some of the ingredients
--- i.e. the pieces of the code dedicated to solve the partial tasks --- that
we can calculate within the code developed so far: one electron Schr\"odinger
equation solved by finite elements in 2D and 3D, for symmetric and nonsymmetric
potentials, and a selfconsistency engine within density functional theory for
radial Dirac and Schr\"odinger equations.

All of that are the essential ingredients for our ultimate goal mentioned above
and we show that this approach seems to be viable -- all of the ingredients are
there and working.

In the future work, what needs to be done is to take our DFT self-consistency
engine tested on the radial Dirac / Schr\"odinger problem and apply our finite
element solver for Kohn-Sham equations with separable pseudopotentials.
