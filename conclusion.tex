In the thesis, we reviewed all the theory that we needed for electonic structure
calculations, in particular density functional theory, radial Dirac and
Schr\"odinger equations, pseudopotentials and finite elements.

We then showed thorough examples of results that we can calculate with our
program, for one electron Schr\"odinger equation in 2D and 3D, for symmetric
and nonsymmetric potentials using finite elements and a density functional
theory program for radial Dirac and Schr\"odinger equations.

All of this are the essential ingredients for reaching our ultimate goal of
doing density functional theory calculations with finite elements and we show
that this approach seems to be viable -- all of the ingredients are there and
working.

In the future work, what needs to be done is to take our DFT self-consistency
cycle from the radial Dirac (or Schr\"odinger) equations and use our finite
element solver to solve the Kohn-Shams equations.
